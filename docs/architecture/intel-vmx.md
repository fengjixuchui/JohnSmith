## Platform gates

The backend requires VMX, firmware-enabled `IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL`, valid VMX fixed bits, EPT, a four-level WB EPT pointer, 2 MiB EPT pages, and INVEPT. VMXON and VMCS regions receive the runtime revision identifier and sit below 4 GiB when `IA32_VMX_BASIC` requires it.

Control words are adjusted through their capability MSRs. VM entry and exit save or restore debug controls, PAT, EFER, and 64-bit host state. Secondary controls enable EPT and conditionally enable RDTSCP, VPID, INVPCID, and XSAVES.

## VMCS and exit pipeline

Each processor owns a VMXON region, VMCS, MSR bitmap, host stack, cached CPUID policy, VPID, EPT views, exit history, and hypercall-page registration.

The VM-exit path:

1. Saves guest GPRs and ABI-volatile XMM registers.
2. Reads exit reason, qualification, instruction length, and guest state.
3. Restores a valid IDT-vectoring event.
4. Synchronizes the active EPT view generation.
5. Handles CPUID, control-register, MSR, VMX-instruction, EPT, and stop exits.
6. Advances RIP only for completed instruction emulation.
7. Restores state and executes `VMRESUME`.

Unknown exits and invalid transition states use distinct fail-stop signatures.

## NMI rendezvous and TSC compensation

Timing-sensitive exits use an epoch-counted VMX-root barrier. The owner sends ICR-low `0x000C4400` through xAPIC MMIO offset `0x300` or x2APIC MSR `0x830`. NMI exiting handles targets in VMX non-root mode. A registered Windows NMI callback handles targets already in VMX-root mode.

EPT violations, intercepted RDTSC/RDTSCP, and intercepted `RDMSR(0x10)` are mandatory rendezvous exits. A matched hook EPT violation reloads the per-CPU budget to eight. Each subsequent non-excluded exit, including CPUID, decrements it. Mandatory exits still rendezvous and consume budget. External interrupts, MTF, and the VMX-preemption timer neither start a rendezvous nor consume budget. CPUID, control-register, other MSR, and GDTR/IDTR/LDTR/TR exits rendezvous only when the budget was nonzero at exit entry.

The compensated interval starts when every participant arrives and ends when owner Finish captures the delta immediately before it publishes `Preparing`. Every participant then prepares before any `VMCS_TSC_OFFSET` write, applies the same delta, and waits for one future resume TSC. Preparation, VMCS apply coordination, the release lead, and final resume overhead stay guest-visible. Acquisition and prepared-count timeouts fail open without compensation. Failures after offset application begins fail stop.

While the phase is `Claimed`, the owner drains old per-CPU join guards and outstanding expected-NMI markers, verifies xAPIC ICR readiness when needed, and rechecks that lifecycle is still `RUNNING` before it advances the epoch. It then publishes `Acquiring`, rechecks that the prior markers remain drained, arms new expected-epoch markers, and broadcasts. Because NMI carries no software tag, an unrelated physical NMI can satisfy or coalesce with an armed marker. This first-NMI assumption still requires hardware validation. The xAPIC preflight occurs before marker arming, so a no-send failure cannot leave stale markers.

## CPUID policy

CPUID exits go through the C handler in Debug, Release, and Benchmark. The policy hides VMX exposure, applies the enabled INVPCID, XSAVES, and RDTSCP masks, and preserves native topology and OS-dependent results. Outside hook proximity, benign CPUID still VM-exits through this path but does not acquire a global rendezvous or broadcast NMIs. Only Benchmark enables the guarded assembly VMCALL fast path.

This policy adds no artificial jitter, broad CPUID cache, forced `CPUID.80000007H:EDX[8]`, assembly CPUID fast path, new `Draining` phase, or change to NMI, APIC, or timeout behavior.

## EPT and VPID

The identity EPT maps up to 512 GiB. RAM uses WB memory type. Non-RAM uses UC. Uniform ranges use 2 MiB leaves. Mixed memory maps, per-page permissions, and hook pages use 4 KiB page tables.

Each processor owns primary and secondary EPT views with independent generation counters. Mapping changes increment the backend generation and rendezvous active processors. The callback uses single-context INVEPT when the CPU supports it and all-context INVEPT otherwise.

Per-CPU VPIDs start at one. INVVPID handles emulated CR3 updates when VPID is active.

## Execute hooks

`IntelHookInstall` validates the target GPA and patch range, prepares the target page in every processor's primary and secondary views, copies the original page into contiguous shadow memory, and applies the patch bytes.

The primary view keeps the original page readable and writable without execute permission. The secondary view maps the shadow page execute-only. EPT violations switch the active view and retry the guest instruction without RIP advancement.

Hook policies live in a fixed slot table and GPA hash. Installation and removal serialize mutations, rendezvous all active processors, restore original PTEs on removal, retire secondary views, and reclaim per-CPU page-table pages after lock-free readers cross an invalidation boundary.

`ObserveHookInstall` builds a trampoline for the displaced instructions and a fixed-size thunk that enters `AsmHookDispatcher`. `HookObserveDispatch` increments the hit counter, calls the registered callback, and returns the trampoline address. Query and list operations expose the hook ID, GPA, cookie, active state, and hit count.

## Control transport

`DriverEntry` reads `Parameters\HypercallSeed`, restricts the service and parameters registry keys to SYSTEM and Administrators, and starts the hypervisor.

The seed derives CPUID subleaves and command identifiers with FNV-1a. A client registers one page on its selected processor. The worker locks that user page with an MDL and services these commands:

- register shared page;
- install, remove, query, and list hooks;
- read and write memory;
- invoke the hook probe.

Process-exit notification releases registered pages. Hypervisor teardown stops the worker, drains rundown protection, removes hooks, resets thunk storage, and frees processor EPT views.

## Teardown and diagnostics

After lifecycle changes to `STOPPING`, common calls the backend quiesce hook. Intel waits for rendezvous phase `Idle` and for all outstanding expected-NMI markers to be consumed before VMXOFF or per-CPU state changes. The NMI callback stays registered through CPU stop and is deregistered only during later backend teardown. A quiesce timeout follows the fail-stop policy.

Before VMXOFF, the stop path captures current guest control, debug, descriptor, PAT, EFER, SYSENTER, FS, and GS state. The assembly return path restores that state after it leaves VMX operation.

Debug builds keep bounded per-CPU VM-exit history. EPT violations, EPT misconfigurations, event collisions, invalidations, and unexpected exits use separate bugcheck signatures.
